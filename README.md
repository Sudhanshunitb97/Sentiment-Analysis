# Sentiment-Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive data science project focused on analyzing student feedback and predicting their ratings using machine learning techniques. It includes various stages such as data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, feature engineering, and model training.

The key tasks in this project involve:

Data Cleaning involves removing stopwords and punctuation and performing tokenization, lemmatization, and spelling corrections on text feedback data.

Feature Engineering: Using techniques like TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and hybrid approaches to extract meaningful features from the text data.

Model Development: Implementing machine learning models to predict student ratings based on their feedback. Techniques used include regression algorithms and hybrid models combining pre-trained and custom word embeddings (Word2Vec).

Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Deployment: Exploring the training model's deployment through interactive dashboards, including using Streamlit to create real-time interactive applications.

The main goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict student ratings (on a scale of 0-10) based on textual feedback, allowing educational institutions to better understand student sentiment and improve services.
